a selection committee was . achievement 
yesterday I attended on the first of this committee meeting . 
and I expected the committee admits that it does knew what to do with the too senators . independent 
what will not concern for the time so . 
the members of the committee can show some selection impact . 
the business that on a senator reshape over the next two years . 
it is a committee , because , in principle , these important nine senators to determine what sit committee some senators . 
i am therefore introduced in the sitting of the committee to me to realize that one of the nine yesterday not attend senators . 
it was sent a replacement . 
honourable senators , I do name person . 
you see how i am now to friendly , ' t it ? 
the senators will have their own to find who was in research fault . 
when an individual a work , it must accept the do . 
the women who sit on the Senate have proven . 
they remplissaient much more that the majority of the men in the Senate their duty . 
i remember as the sessions held that the committee to the of veterans in February 1998 . 
the Senate or the House of Commons do Ni sitting in this time . 
three senators sat in the proceedings of the committee , all of the Liberals have women . 
the officers of the Senate could not find a man to this committee . 
i could cite word , to , what the hon. senator Carstairs took answered the question I asked word . 
i asked him : " Quels were the criteria are as follows ? " 
it was the first to address the representation of women in a report has stated that she . 
that it had on the parliamentary associations drafted in 1993 . 
delegations Les at the time were only of men formées . 
on this matter , I was on the senator replaced by Finestone for a number of years . 
however , I still the opportunity to look my association preferred . re - enter 
honourable senators , I do not know how when the House will be or about these two reports decision . 
every time the that are senators on television verdict . 
or by a group of students , to journalists wondered or any . 
say that we do ? 
it is true , and I will believe . 
however , it should be bring in fact . 
i do not believe in the replacing . 
if a accept this position in a committee , he or it should participate in all the senator meetings intended . 
we are not the members of the words in which the corridors : 
" Présentez to committee today and do you , after years of education , there is a vote two in committee '' . final 
they do not even know what they are viewed , but they came to when their leaders sang sang to them . 
they do not know what has happened absolutely not . 
honourable the words " senators , " and " continuité '' are in the way in our dedication speech . 
over the next two weeks , beginning to reflect on the way we will address the situation of the independent senators . 
if we are not , I non - my own créerai of Parliament who are interested in the world affairs committee .
